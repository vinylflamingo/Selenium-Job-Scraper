# Selenium Job Scraper
Hello! Thanks for checking out my portfolio project. This script searches dynamic job listing for keywords from hirebridge websites.
Should a match be found, it will send a text message using the twilio api, and it will return what job title it found. 

Although this script is short, it is immensly useful if your waiting for a position to open and don't want to manually search it.
Set the script to run once per day and voila! A extra set of eyes will be watching the job listings for you. Thanks Selenium!
